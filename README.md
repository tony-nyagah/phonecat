# PhoneCat

A simple phone catalog inspired by the AngularJS tutorial. The catalog will be made in various frontend frameworks.

This project is being made since I am on a team working on moving an AngularJS site to a newer frontend framework that's not deprecated.

Link to said AngularJS tutorial: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial.

Link to the AngularJS phonecat GitHub: https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat.

The final product is supposed to look like what's in the link: https://angular.github.io/angular-phonecat/step-14/app/#!/phones.
